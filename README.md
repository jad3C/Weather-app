# Weather-app
In this project I created a weather app, which uses an API from openweathermap to get weather information all over the world. You can use locate button to get weather data at your location. You can also use search to find the current weather at a city, for example New York or Los Angeles. The app displays local temperature, gives you a brief description and also shows an icon based on the weather.
